# Temperature Forecast using ML

### Purpose:

The goal of the project is to predict what will be the maximum and minimum temperature for the next day. I am using RMSE metric to evaluate my Linear Model performance.

### Dataset:

Includes 7752 observations and 25 features

### Technical Requirements:

* Python 3.8.8
* Numpy 1.20.1
* Sklearn 0.23.2
* Seaborn 0.11.1
* Pandas 1.2.4
* Matplotlib 3.3.4

### Project Deliverables:

* Data pre-processing
* Data Exploration
* Feature selection
* Evaluating Linear regression model with all features and with recursive feature elimination.
